# xrplgrants-wave3

There is no code in this repository because SumAssembly will present on the XRPL network as an intermediary for the payer and payee.  This functionality is **transparent**, and a payer need only use the existing [`PaymentChannelCreate`](https://xrpl.org/payment-channels.html) functionality to send funds. Channels will only be permitted to verified payers, and SumAssembly will provide the float/reserve necessary to settle with the payee.  We strive to maximise utility by building this service within the existing capabilities of the network, and not require updates or changes.

Using the publicly available payment channel feature provided by XRPL, we will ingest that information and use it to pay out via various integrated partnerships around the globe. The connections we maintain with these partnerships are proprietary, but we are able to share details after a mutual NDA is signed.

The unique value proposition of Accrue by SumAssembly is not only the payout relationships, but the depth of experience in payments, and focused goal to make payouts more efficient for not only the payer, but for the payee, as well. Giving options to each party for currency, periodicity, and amount at T+0 (or even T- up to 30 days for companies that opt into our “prepay” model), is a far more robust solution than anything that exists today.
